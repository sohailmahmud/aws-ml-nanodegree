## AWS Machine Learning Scholarship Program Overview!
### Course Overview
* Lesson 2: Introduction to Machine Learning – In this lesson, you will learn the fundamentals of supervised and unsupervised machine learning, including the process steps of solving machine learning problems, and explore several examples.
* Lesson 3: Machine Learning with AWS – In this lesson, you will learn about advanced machine learning techniques such as generative AI, reinforcement learning, and computer vision. You will also learn how to train these models with AWS AI/ML services.
* Lesson 4: Software Engineering Practices, part 1 – In this lesson, you will learn how to write well-documented, modularized code.
* Lesson 5: Software Engineering Practices, part 2 – In this lesson, you will learn how to test your code and log best practices.
* Lesson 6: Object-Oriented Programming – In this lesson, you will learn about this programming style and prepare to write your own Python package.
### By the end of the course, you will be able to...
* Explain machine learning and the types of questions machine learning can help to solve.
* Explain what machine learning solutions AWS offers and how AWS AI devices put machine learning in the hands of every developer.
* Apply software engineering principles of modular code, code efficiency, refactoring, documentation, and version control to data science.
* Apply software engineering principles of testing code, logging, and conducting code reviews to data science.
* Implement the basic principles of object-oriented programming to build a Python package.
